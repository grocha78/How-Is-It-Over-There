## Challenge
- Build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS

## Purpose
- Familiarize oneself with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery and Bootstrap

## Features
- When site is visited, I can type in a city to get the weather conditions
- I am then presented with current for that city and that city is added to the search history
- When I view the UV index, I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
- I can also view future weather conditions for that city, with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
- When I click on a city in the search history I am then presented with current and future conditions for that city
